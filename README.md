# opentest4k
multiplatform implementation/bindings of [opentest4j](https://github.com/ota4j-team/opentest4j)

## Platform Differences

1. Serialization support is dropped for js and native targets.
2. `getType()` is exposed as `valueType` in order for it to be a `KClass<*>`.
3. `ValueWrapper.create()` is exposed as the extension method `toValueWrapper()`.
